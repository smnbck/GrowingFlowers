# GrowingFlowers

This WoW Vanilla AddOn guides players through the game from Level 1 to 60 by showing instructions right inside the WoW UI. 
The instructions are based on the Vanilla Leveling Guides made by Brian Kopp (Alliance) and Joana (Horde). 
It's still in development and doesn't offer a lot of functionality but it's pretty lightweight and easy to use.
Currently lots of instructions are still missing.

- After downloading the AddOn from GitHub you need to rename the folder from GrowingFlowers-master to GrowingFlowers
- For toggling the window type in /growingflowerstoggle or /gftoggle
