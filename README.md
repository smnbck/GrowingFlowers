# GrowingFlowers

This WoW Vanilla AddOn guides players from Level 1 to 60 by showing instructions right inside the WoW UI. 
They are based on the Vanilla Leveling Guides made by Brian Kopp (Alliance) and Joana (Horde). 
The AddOn is still in development and doesn't offer a lot of functionality but it's pretty lightweight and easy to use.
Currently lots of instructions are still missing.

- After downloading the AddOn from GitHub you need to rename the folder from GrowingFlowers-master to GrowingFlowers. Otherwise it won't work
- For toggling the window type in /growingflowerstoggle or /gftoggle
